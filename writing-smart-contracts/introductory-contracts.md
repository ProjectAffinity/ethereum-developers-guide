## Introductory Contracts

Now we will begin our first foray into writing larger and more useful smart contracts projects using Truffle.

###### [Proof of Existence](https://blog.zeppelin.solutions/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-smart-contracts-in-ethereum-848f08001f05) \[Exercise\]

One of the blockchain's most interesting use cases is using it for proof of existence.  Essentially, you can put the hash of some document or data in the blockchain so that at a future date, you can prove that you owned a piece of data at the time it was uploaded to the blockchain.  In this tutorial by Zeppelin Solutions, you will learn how to create a proof of existence contract on Ethereum, build and deploy it using Truffle, and iterate on new versions.

###### [Pet Shop Backend](http://truffleframework.com/tutorials/pet-shop) \[Exercise\]

Next, we will follow this tutorial by Truffle to create a smart contract to handle ownership of something, in this case pets!  Do only up until _Creating a UI to Interact with our Smart Contract_.  We will come back to the UI section later.
