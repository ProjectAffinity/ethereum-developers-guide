## Upgradable Contracts

Once a contract is deployed to the chain, the code of the contract cannot be changed.  This is plays into the immutability aspect of blockchains.  However, sometimes you need to be able to update contract code because perhaps a bug has been found or the project is in development with staged rollouts.  In this section, we will learn how to do this.
