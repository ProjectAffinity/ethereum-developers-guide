## Using Libraries

When developing decentralized applications, it often doesn't make sense for every developer to reinvent the wheel when it comes to basic functions.  For this reason, in order to act more like programming languages you may be more familiar with, Solidity supports libraries, reusable pieces of code.

This article from Jorge Izquierdo of Aragon provides a comprehensive review on how to develop more modular, reusable and elegant smart contract systems on top of the Ethereum Virtual Machine by using libraries.

In this short article, Piper Merriam demonstrates another potential benefit of using libraries, that for contracts that are not called often, they can potentially be more gas efficient due to need to deploy less code on the chain.

###### [ERC190](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/190) \[5 min read\]

A common standard called ERC190 was created to allow to make it as easy possible to use and develop common shared libraries.  Learn about its basics by reading its specification.

Until now code re-use involved copy/pasting smart contract source code from project to project. We’ve been unable to take advantage of some of the most powerful properties of the EVM, specifically the ability to have common shared libraries that are deployed once and used by all. We don’t even have a standard library.
