###### [Ethereum Subtleties](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/subtleties) \[4 min read\]

An explanation of the subtleties of Ethereum. Black hats don't often lurk in the daylight of the obvious, but in the darkness of subtleties where much fewer white hats roam. For example, one of the DoS attacks used “note: there is a difference between zero-balance and nonexistent!”

In this talk from dev con 2, Joseph Chow of ConsenSys walks us through some common things to avoid when developing and deploying smart contracts, using illustrative examples.

###### [Compiler Bugs](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/bugs.html) \[3 min read\]

Occasionally, a nightly version of the Solidity compiler itself may contain bugs. It is suggested to avoid using any compiler version that is known to be faulty in some way.  This page from the [Solidity docs](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/index.html) has a list of some of the known compiler bugs.

This list compiled by [King of the Ether](https://www.kingoftheether.com/thrones/kingoftheether/index.html) records some of the most common known bugs and attack vectors found in Ethereum smart contracts.  Read through this list and then in the following resources, as the following articles will explore some of these in greater depth. Also, explore the bugs within the King of the Ether app via the [Post-Mortem Investigation](http://www.kingoftheether.com/postmortem.html), which lead to the creation of the Contract Safety Checklist.

###### [Analysis of TheDAO Exploit](http://hackingdistributed.com/2016/06/18/analysis-of-the-dao-exploit/) \[4 min read\]

This article by Phil Daian explains the reentrancy attack that affected TheDAO and cost over $150 million USD.

###### [Tx.origin](http://vessenes.com/tx-origin-and-ethereum-oh-my/) \[5 min read\]

Often times, contracts mistakingly use the tx.origin to test for who is calling a function, when they mean to use msg.sender.  This article by Peter Vessenes explains why this is dangerous and can, and has, lead to malicious behavior.

In this reddit post, Vitalik Buterin exposes underhanded code \(code that is written to appear simple, but contains a hidden bug or exploit\) that tried to steal money by naming variables slightly different things so as to be missed by a quick reader.
