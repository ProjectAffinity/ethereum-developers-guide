## Is this guide for me?

This guidebook is designed for technical developers who are looking to get into smart contract and dapp development and have a decent understanding of what blockchains are and how they work.

If this does not describe you, please feel free to follow one of the following options.

**What's a SHA256 hash function!? I'm completely non-technical. I just want to learn about what blockchain is and how it can help my business!**

Please read this guide.

**I am a developer but don't know much about the technical underpinnings of Ethereum or Blockchain technologies.**

Please first [this guide first.](https://www.gitbook.com/book/sunnya97/a-technical-guide-to-ethereum-and-related-technol/details)

**I know a little bit about blockchain, but very little about programming.**

If you're brand new to programming, we suggest using a resource like [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python) or [LearnPythonTheHardWay](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/) to begin learning basic coding skills. We recommend starting with Python as it offers a nice balance of simplicity and versatility for beginners. From there, consider moving on to Javascript as it is the basis of most web programming today as well as being to closest to Solidity \(the main smart contract programming language for Ethereum\). Once you feel you have a decent grasp of programming concepts, please come back to this guide.** **
