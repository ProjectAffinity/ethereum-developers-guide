## Is this guide for me?

This guidebook is designed for developers who are looking to get into smart contract and decentralized application \(dapp\) development and have a decent understanding of what blockchains are and how they work.

If you have never heard of a blockchain, or you have no experience with development, please explore the options below. 

**What's a hash function!? I don't know how to program! I just want to learn about what blockchain is and how it can help my business!**

Please read this guide.

**I am a developer, but I just heard of blockchain today. I have no idea how it works!**

Please first [this guide first.](https://www.gitbook.com/book/sunnya97/a-technical-guide-to-ethereum-and-related-technol/details)

**I don't know anything about programming, but I want to learn!**

If you're brand new to programming, we suggest using a resource like [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python) or [LearnPythonTheHardWay](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/) to begin learning basic coding skills. We recommend starting with Python as it offers a nice balance of simplicity and versatility for beginners. From there, consider moving on to Javascript as it is the basis of most web programming today as well as being to closest to Solidity \(the main smart contract programming language for Ethereum\). Once you feel you have a decent grasp of programming concepts, please come back to this guide.** **
