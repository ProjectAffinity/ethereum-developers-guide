# Setting up your Dev Environment

###### [Installing Mist](https://www.gitbook.com/book/sunnya97/a-beginner-s-guide-to-ethereum-and-dapp-developme/edit#) \[Exercise\]

Unlike most other blockchains, Ethereum has multiple clients that can sync the Ethereum blockchain.  While the Parity client is very powerful and fast, because most external resources are written for Go-Ethereum \(geth\), we will be installing and using this client.This tutorial will walk you through downloading and installing the Mist Wallet, which comes bundled with the Geth client.

###### [Connect Mist to the TestRPC](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/3380/how-to-enable-and-mine-testnet-morden) \[Exercise\]

By default, Mist connects to the Geth client.  However, for testing purposes, it is nice to be able to use it with your private TestRPC network.  This will be especially useful for the next tutorial.

###### [Using Mist](https://ethereum.org/token) \[Exercise\]

Now that we have Mist and Geth installed, let's try to use them to make a simple token 

###### [Remix Tutorial](http://remix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_mist.html) \[Exercise\]

In this tutorial, you will learn to use the Remix Tool \(Browser Solidity\).  Remix is the easiest tool to get started with application development. It allows rapid prototyping, testing, and helpful debugging when writing your first smart contracts.

While you can use Geth to create transactiones, it is very convenient to have a quick and easy way to interact with the Ethereum blockchain from within your browser.  This initial video from Metamask introduces their tool and how you can use it in the Chrome browser.
