# A Beginner's Guide for Ethereum Developers



This beginner's guide will help you develop a mental model of blockchain and Ethereum technology and give you the knowledge and tools to begin developing decentralized applications on top of this technology.

This guide will not be structured as book or a single tutorial.  Rather, it should be thought of as an index of knowledge and resources. The blockchain industry is a collaborative industry, and as such, this guide will consist largely of links to material created and published by other members of the community, some from within ConsenSys and some not.
