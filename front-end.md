## Front End

While this guidebook is focused on smart contract development, a large portion of successful Dapp development is the front end - the user interface.  In this section, we provide introduction to interacting your smart contracts with a useable frontend, and introduce the resources for front end development.

Picking up where we left off in the Pet Shop Truffle tutorial in the subsection [Introductory Contracts](https://sunnya97.gitbooks.io/a-beginner-s-guide-to-ethereum-and-dapp-developme/writing-smart-contracts/introductory-contracts.html), we will now build the UI that will allow our users to interact with the smart contract we built.
