# Storage vs. Memory

By now, you understand that smart contracts are interacted with through transaction on the Ethereum blockchain. As a result, there is a distinction between storage and memory in Ethereum. Storage is the stuff that persists in-between Ethereum transactions, while memory is transaction specific. This can be thought of similarly to global variables.

This short stack overflow post explains the difference between the two analogizing them to the memory and hard disk of a computer as well as explaining a bit about how the EVM deals with both of them.

###### [Data Location](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/types.html#data-location) \[3 min read\]

Read the Data Location subsection from Types section of the Solidity docs once again, and see if you can understanding it better know that you know the difference between storage and memory.

###### [Memory Keyword](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/frequently-asked-questions.html#what-is-the-memory-keyword-what-does-it-do) \[1 min read\]

This answer from the FAQ section of the Solidity devs provides an explanation of how to use the memory and storage keywords and the default location of variables when not specified.
